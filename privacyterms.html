Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and FLDR, LLC agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or breach thereof (whether or not such disputes involve a third party), that cannot be resolved in small claims court shall be settled by binding individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association and all parties agree to hereby expressly waive trial by jury.  This is to include all claims and disputes, whether contract, tort, including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service. You and FLDR, LLC are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. You may only bring claims on your own behalf. Neither you nor FLDR, LLC will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. If the American Arbitration Administration is not available to arbitrate within 160 days of filing the case, then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. All arbitration will be administered through a neutral arbiter. 
Claims or disputes that seek $10,000.00 USD or less can be resolved through binding non-appearance arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. Any claim greater than $10,000 USD, will have the right to a hearing to be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgement on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered on any court of competent jurisdiction. In cases of Non-appearance arbitration, the arbitration may be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions or any of combination of the three. Neither party will have to make any personal appearance unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. You will not participate in any claims brought in by a private attorney in general or representative capacity or consolidated claims involving another user and their account if FLDR, LLC is a party to the proceeding.  No arbitrator will have the authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. <br /> <br />
You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor FLDR, LLC can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify us in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include, your full legal name, email address (if used to set up your FLDR account) and FLDR user name if you have one and your written statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement. Statements cannot be withdrawn once submitted. You must email your opt out statement to app@myfldr.com.  This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with FLDR, LLC.
<h3>Time Limit On Claims</h3>
By agreeing to use the Service as set forth by our terms and conditions, you agree that any claims you have arising out of your use of or related to the Service must be filed within one year after the claim arose, otherwise your claim will be permanently barred from submission. 
<br /><br />
